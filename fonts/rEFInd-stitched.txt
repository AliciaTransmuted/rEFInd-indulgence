The included rEFInd-stitched font is a hand drawn font. Finding a suitable handwritten monospaced font, also called a fixed-pitch, fixed-width, or non-proportional font is quite a challenge. Fortunatly, it was pretty straight forward to use an existing rEFInd png font as a base for rEFInd-stitched.png

Feel free to use it as a base for other rEFInd theme projects. I recommend that you use rEFInd-stitched-112.png as your base file to allow for details, and then scale it down to size.
1. Import into Gimp, Krita, Inkscape, etc.
2. Reduce opacity of original layer to about 50%.
3. Create a transparent layer above the current layer.
4. Increase magnification to about 400%.
5. Hand trace your font over the original.
   Using a tablet will, no doubt, give you much cleaner and polished results.
   I did mine with a mouse in Gimp 2.10.6... at 400%, it's pretty easy.
6. Play around with different brushes to give you different desired effects.
   e.g. chalk, felt pen, dry erase marker, etc.
   Sometimes a low tech solution gives you exactly what you wanted...
